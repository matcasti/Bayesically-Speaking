Matías is a researcher and a statistics geek with (more than) a little taste for bayesian methods, but more importantly an applied coffee lover.

In this corner of the web he will be working and sharing real world problems using applied statistics to develop insights and to provide an inference-based framework towards an unified perspective, quantifying the uncertainty behind those problems and the potential solutions associated with them.

Feel free to reach Matías if you wish to collaborate or leave your feedback on any of the published material hosted in *Bayesically Speaking*.
