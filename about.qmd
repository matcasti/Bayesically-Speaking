I'm Mat√≠as, statistics geek, researcher in-the-making with (more than) a little taste for bayesian methods and a pizza lover.

In this little corner of the web I'll be working with some real world problems using applied statistics to develop insights and (hopefully) provide an inference-based framework towards a more unified perspective on what is known (and unknown).
