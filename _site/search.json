    "text": "The statistics toolbox\nWithin the statistics toolbox, we have commonly used tests like t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, and regression. These methods have their advantages, as they are relatively easy to use and understand. However, like any other tool, they also have their limitations. For instance, they struggle with scenarios involving variables with asymmetric distributions, non-linear relationships, unbalanced groups, heterogeneous variance, extreme values, or repeated measurements with loss of follow-up.\nTo address these limitations, non-parametric alternatives have been developed. These approaches offer flexibility but make it challenging to extrapolate inferences to new data due to the lack of distributional parameters. Other models, such as neural networks or random forest models, provide assistance when analyzing data with special properties. However, they often sacrifice simplicity and interpretability for increased flexibility and are commonly referred to as “black box” models.\n\n\n\nThis is between us, I just put this photo because I thought it would look cooler. Photo from Dan Cristian Pădureț at Unsplash.\n\n\nDespite the availability of these alternative methods, there is still a pressing need to incorporate previous knowledge and align with the way human understanding is constructed. As humans, our perception of the world is shaped by experiences and prior beliefs. This is where Bayesian statistics come into play.\nBayesian statistics offer several advantages over classical statistics (also known as “frequentist”). Firstly, they provide a coherent framework for incorporating prior information into our analysis, enabling us to update our beliefs systematically. Additionally, Bayesian statistics allow us to quantify uncertainty through probability distributions, offering a more intuitive and interpretable way to express our findings and the degree of certainty."

    "section": "Computing the posterior",
    "text": "Computing the posterior\nTo estimate the posterior probability of getting heads after tossing a coin, we can use the Bayesian framework. Let’s denote the probability of getting heads in a coin toss as \\(P(H)\\).\nAccording to the information provided, we have the prior probability of \\(P(H)\\) estimated from an independent experiment as 10 heads out of 15 tosses. This can be written as a Beta distribution:\n\n\nThis symbol “\\(\\sim\\)” means distributed as\n\\[\nP(H) \\sim Beta(10, 5)\n\\]\nHere, the Beta distribution parameters are (10, 5) since we had 10 heads and 5 tails in the prior experiment.\nNow, a new experiment with the same 15 tosses gives us 2 heads. To update our prior belief, we can use this information to calculate the posterior probability which can be expressed as follow:\n\n\nThis symbol “\\(\\propto\\)” means proportional to\n\\[\nP(H | Data) \\propto P(Data | H) \\times P(H)\n\\]\nWhich is equivalent as saying:\n\\[\nPosterior \\propto Likelihood \\times Prior\n\\]\nTo calculate the posterior probability, we need to normalize the product of the likelihood and prior, which involves integrating over all possible values of H. However, in this case, we can use a shortcut because the prior distribution is conjugate to the binomial distribution, so the posterior distribution will also follow a Beta distribution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout normalization\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product of both the prior and the likelihood maintains the same shape as the final posterior probability distribution, indicated by the “proportional to” (\\(\\propto\\)) in the previous equation. However, this raw product does not sum up to 1, making it an improper probability density function. To rectify this, the raw product needs to be normalized using integration or simulation in most cases.\n\n\n\n\\[\nP(H | Data) \\sim Beta(10 + 2, 5 + 13)\n\\]\nAfter incorporating the data from the new experiment, the parameters of the Beta distribution become (12, 18) since we had 2 heads and 13 tails in the new experiment, meaning 12 heads and 18 tails in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout conjugacy\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we choose a Beta distribution as our prior belief and gather new data from a coin toss, an intriguing property emerges: the posterior distribution also follows a Beta distribution. This property, known as conjugacy, offers a valuable advantage by simplifying calculations. It acts as a mathematical shortcut that saves time and effort, making the analysis more efficient and streamlined.\n\n\n\nTo calculate the posterior probability of getting heads, we can consider the mode (maximum) of the Beta distribution, which is \\((a - 1) / (a + b - 2)\\):\n\n\\(\\begin{aligned} P(H | Data) &= (12 - 1) / (12 + 18 - 2) \\\\  &= 11 / 28 \\\\  &\\approx 0.39 \\end{aligned}\\)\n\nTherefore, the posterior probability of getting heads is approximately 39% when we consider all the available evidence.\n\n\nCode\n# Prior and Likelihood functions\ndata = function(x, to_log = FALSE) dbeta(x, 2, 13, log = to_log)\nprior = function(x, to_log = FALSE) dbeta(x, 10, 5, log = to_log)\n\n# Posterior\nposterior = function(x) {\n  p_fun = function(i) {\n    # Operation is on log-scale merely for computing performance\n    # and minimize rounding errors giving the small nature of\n    # probability density values at each interval.\n    i_log = data(i, to_log = TRUE) + prior(i, to_log = TRUE)\n    # Then transformed back to get probabilities again\n    exp(i_log)\n  }\n  \n  # Then we integrate using base function `integrate`\n  const = integrate(f = p_fun, \n                    lower = 0L,  upper = 1L, \n                    subdivisions = 1e3L,\n                    rel.tol = .Machine$double.eps)$value\n  p_fun(x) / const\n}\n\n## Plotting phase\n\n### Color palette\ncol_pal <- c(Prior = \"#DEEBF7\", \n             Data = \"#3182BD\", \n             Posterior = \"#9ECAE1\")\n### Main plotting code\nggplot() +\n  #### Main probability density functions\n  stat_function(aes(fill = \"Data\"), fun = data, geom = \"density\", alpha = 1/2) +\n  stat_function(aes(fill = \"Prior\"), fun = prior, geom = \"density\", alpha = 1/2) +\n  stat_function(aes(fill = \"Posterior\"), fun = posterior, geom = \"density\", alpha = 1/2) +\n  #### Minor aesthetics tweaks\n  labs(fill = \"\", y = \"Density\", x = \"Probability of getting heads\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = col_pal, aesthetics = \"fill\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(), \n                     limits = c(0,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 6.5)) +\n  see::theme_modern() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.spacing.x = unit(3, \"mm\")) +\n  #### Arrows\n  geom_curve(aes(x = .81, y = 4.1, xend = .69232, yend = 3.425), curvature = .4,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(1/3, \"cm\"), angle = 20)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = .9, y = 4.1, label = \"Beta(10,5)\")) +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = .2, y = 5.9, xend = .07693, yend = 5.45), curvature = .4,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(1/3, \"cm\"), angle = 20)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = .29, y = 5.85, label = \"Beta(2,13)\")) +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = .5, y = 5, xend = .3847, yend = 4.4), curvature = .4,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(1/3, \"cm\"), angle = 20)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = .55, y = 5, label = \"≈ 39%\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical representation of the posterior probability as the combination of both the data and the prior evidence"

I have a special interest in bayesian methods, which are a powerful and flexible way of doing statistics that allows you to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty into your analysis. Bayesian methods are not magic, though. They have their limitations and challenges, just like any other approach. That’s why I don’t shy away from using other tools when they are appropriate, such as frequentist methods or p-values.
