It's all thanks to an incredibly complex, yet surprisingly efficient communication network, **your nervous system**. Think of it as the internet of your body, but instead of cat videos and online shopping, it's buzzing with **urgent messages about survival** (like pizza acquisition) and other important stuff, like not walking into walls.\n\nThis network relies on **specialized cells called neurons**, which are basically your body's tiny gossips. They constantly chatter with each other, passing along information in the form of rapid electrical signals called action potentials. **These aren't your grandma's static shocks**; they're more like carefully crafted Morse code messages, zipping along neural pathways at impressive speeds. **Imagine each neuron as a tiny town crier**, shouting the latest news (or sensory input) to the next town over.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, **\"Electrical signals? Sounds complicated.\"** And you'd be right. But fear not! In this post, we're going to break down the magic behind action potentials using a simplified mathematical model. Think of it as a cheat sheet for understanding how these tiny electrical storms work. **We'll start with the basics and gradually add complexity**, like adding extra gossip to the town crier's message, until we have a decent understanding of the dynamics at play. **No PhD in neuroscience required (though a craving for pizza is always helpful)**. So, buckle up, because we're about to drive into the electrifying world of neuronal communication!\n\n![](action-potential-neuron.png){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Photo from [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/action-potential)]{.aside}\n\n# The Neuron as a Simple Circuit: A First Approximation\n\n**Let's imagine our neuron not as a bustling town crier, but as a tiny, slightly bored house**. It's got walls (the cell membrane), an inside (intracellular fluid), and an outside (extracellular fluid). These fluids are salty solutions, full of charged particles called ions like **sodium, potassium, and chloride (the electrolyte gang you see advertised in sports drinks)**. Now, because these fluids have different concentrations of these ions, there's a difference in electrical charge between the inside and the outside of the house. **This difference in charge is what we call the <u>membrane potential<\\u>**, measured in millivolts (mV). Think of it like a tiny battery inside the neuron, just waiting to be used.\n\nNormally, this \"battery\" sits at a **resting voltage of around -70 mV**. Why negative? It's just a convention: **we define the outside of the cell as zero**, and the inside is negatively charged relative to it. So, our little neuron house is just chilling, with a slight negative charge inside (like a grumpy teenager refusing to get out of bed).\n\nNow, **our neuron's walls (the membrane) aren't completely airtight**. They have tiny holes, called **<u>leak channels</u>**, which allow some ions to slowly trickle in and out. **It's like having a slightly leaky faucet**, not a major flood, but a constant drip. These leaks are crucial because they maintain that resting membrane potential.\n\n![](leakage-channels.jpg){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Photo from [Neuroscience: Canadian 1st Edition](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/neurosciencecdn/chapter/anatomy-physiology-the-nervous-system-and-nervous-tissue/)]{.aside}\n\nAnother important property of the membrane is its **ability to store electrical charge**, much like a capacitor in an electronic circuit. **This is called <u>capacitance</u>**. Imagine the membrane as two conductive plates (the inside and outside of the cell) separated by an insulator (the membrane itself). When there's a difference in charge across the membrane (our membrane potential), **it stores some of that charge**. It's like a tiny electrical reservoir, ready to release its charge when needed.\n\nSo, to summarize our lazy neuron house:\n\n-   **Membrane potential:** A voltage difference between the inside and outside.\n-   **Leak channels:** Tiny holes that allow ions to slowly leak across the membrane, maintaining the resting potential.\n-   **Capacitance:** The membrane's ability to store electrical charge.\n\n#### Expanding our Intuition Using Math: Waking Up the Sleeping Neuron\n\n**Right now, our neuron is basically a zombie**. It's just sitting there, leaking a bit of charge and generally being a bit of a slacker. No exciting messages, no action potentials, **it's like a town crier who's decided to take an eternal nap**. But fear not! Things are about to get much more interesting. We're about to introduce the real heroes of the story: **voltage-gated ion channels**.\n\n![](voltage-dependent-channels.jpeg){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Photo from [Neuroscience: Canadian 1st Edition](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/neurosciencecdn/chapter/anatomy-physiology-the-nervous-system-and-nervous-tissue/)]{.aside}\n\nNow, **let's get a little mathematical here** (don't worry, we'll keep it fun!). We need a function to describe **how the membrane potential** ($V$) **changes over time** ($t$) due to all that pesky leakage. \n\nSo, what kind of function would you use to describe something that decays gradually, like a deflating balloon? You guessed it! **We need an exponential function**, that classic workhorse of mathematical modeling. \n\nExponential functions look something like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ninput <- seq(0, 8, by = 0.01)\n\ndf <- data.table(input = input,\n           `e^x` = exp(input),\n           `-e^x` = -exp(input),\n           `e^{-x}` = exp(-input),\n           `-e^{-x}` = -exp(-input))\n\ndf <- melt(df, id.vars = \"input\")\n\nggplot(df, aes(input, value)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, labeller = \"label_parsed\", scales = \"free_y\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 1/2, \n             linetype = 2, col = \"gray50\") +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, \n                col = \"orange\") +\n  labs(x = \"Input\", y = \"Output\",\n       title = \"Exponential Function Dynamics\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Exponential Function and Common Variations**. Here we see how changing a small detail in the original function (in this case a negative sign) can yield dramatically different behavior.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, we can see that the bottom variations of the exponential function (the ones with negative exponents) **seem to behave more like a neuron should**. They oscillate nicely, staying within a reasonable range. This function with the negative exponent, $e^{-x}$, seems like a good starting point to describe **how the membrane potential gradually returns to its resting state**. It's like watching a deflating balloon (slow and steady).\n\n#### Customizing It Further: Tweaking the Decay Rate\n\nNow, let's get a little more creative! **We can tweak this function to control how quickly the membrane potential returns to rest**. Imagine it's like adjusting the valve on a tire, you can control how fast the air leaks out. \n\nWe can do this by adding a \"**rate parameter**\" to our exponent. Instead of just $e^{-x}$, we can use $e^{-x \\cdot \\lambda}$. This $\\lambda$ value acts **like a speed control for the decay**. By changing $\\lambda$, we can adjust how quickly the membrane potential returns to its resting value. It's like having a dial to control how fast the balloon deflates.\n\nLet's visualize this change and see how it affects the decay rate!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ninput <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.01)\n\ndf <- lapply(X = seq(0, 1.4, by = 0.2), function(x) {\n  data.table(Input = input, \n             lambda = format(x, digits = 1, nsmall = 1),\n             Output = exp(-input * x))\n}) |> rbindlist()\n\nggplot(df, aes(Input, Output, color = ordered(lambda))) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 1/2, \n             linetype = 2, col = \"gray50\") +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(color = expression(lambda),\n       y = expression(e^{-x*lambda}),\n       title = expression(\"Rate Parameter (\"*lambda*\") on Output Dynamics\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Effect of Rate Parameter on Function Dynamics**. Here we see that by altering the rate parameter $\\lambda$ we can toy around with \"how fast\" our exponential function is returning to baseline.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! **Now we need to give this function a little personality**. Right now, it's a bit generic. It always starts at 1 and decays towards 0. But **what if we want to start at a different value?** Or maybe we want it to **decay towards a different value than 0?**\n\nNo problem! We can easily customize this function. \n\nFirst, let's give it a starting point. We can add a multiplicative factor (let's call it $b$) to the exponential function. **This is like giving our function a \"starting height\"**. Now, our function looks like this:\n\n$$\nb \\cdot e^{-x \\cdot \\lambda}\n$$\n\nNext, **let's give it a target value**. We can add a linear factor (let's call it $a$) to shift the entire curve up or down. This is **like setting a new \"ground level\"** for our function. \n\n\nWith these adjustments, our function now looks like this:\n\n$$\na + b \\cdot e^{-x \\cdot \\lambda}\n$$\n\n**This gives us much more flexibility!** For example, if we set $a$ to 0 and $b$ to 1, we get our original function. **It's like having a basic template and then customizing it** to fit our specific needs. \n\n![](exponential-function-cartoon.jpeg){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[In fact, she did use it at the end. Photo from Frank Mariani in [Cartoonist for Hire](https://www.cartoonistforhire.com/frank-mariani-book-illustration/)]{.aside}\n\nBut wait a minute! We've been doing all this math, and **we haven't even talked about neurons yet!** What was the point of all this mental gymnastics? Well, it turns out that this seemingly random function has a **very real biological meaning**. \n\nLet's take a look at that equation again, but this time with some real neuron terms:\n\n$$\nV(t) = E_L + (V_0 - E_L) \\cdot e^{-g_L \\cdot t}\n$$\n\nNow, this equation starts to make sense. It tells us how the membrane potential ($V$) changes over time ($t$). It's like watching a movie of the membrane potential. \n\n- $V(t)$: This is the **membrane potential at any given moment**, the voltage across the cell membrane at that exact instant.\n- $E_L$: This is the **\"leak reversal potential\"**, the magical voltage where the leak channels are perfectly balanced. It's like the *\"sweet spot\"* for the membrane, usually close to the resting membrane potential (around -70 mV). This is the value our function will try to get over time.\n- $V_0$: This is the starting point, **the initial membrane potential** at time $t = 0$. It's like the starting position in a race.\n- $g_L$: This is the **\"leak conductance\"**, a measure of *how easily* ions can leak through the membrane. Think of it as how wide the leaky faucet is open. A higher $g_L$ means ions leak faster, and the membrane potential changes more quickly.\n- $e^{-g_L \\cdot t}$: This is **the exponential decay term**, the engine that drives the change. It ensures that the membrane potential gradually approaches $E_L$ over time, like a car slowly coming to a stop.\n\n\nNow, **let's get a little more mathematical**. If we want to express how the membrane potential changes over time, **we need to find the \"rate of change\"** of the membrane potential. In math terms, this is called the *derivative*. \n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n![](confused-math.gif){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[**Average Bayesically-Speaking reader** going through the content on a typical blog post after I say \"We'll start with the basics\".

It tells us how quickly the voltage is rising or falling.\n- $g_L$: This is our old friend, the **leak conductance**. A higher $g_L$ means the membrane is *\"more leaky\"*, and the membrane potential will change more rapidly.\n- $(V_0 - E_L)$: This term represents **the \"driving force\"** for the leak current. The bigger the difference between the current potential and the leak reversal potential, the stronger the *\"urge\"* for the membrane potential to return to equilibrium. It's like a ball rolling down a steep hill, the steeper the hill, the faster it rolls.\n\nIf the next plot, we'll see the solution to this equation, **an exponential decay curve**. It's like watching a ball rolling down a hill, it starts fast but gradually slows down as it approaches the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Parameters\ntime <- seq(0, 50, 0.1) # Time vector\n\n# Function to calculate membrane potential over time\nmembrane_potential <- function(time, V0, g_L, E_L) {\n  V <- (V0 - E_L) * exp(-g_L * time) + E_L\n  return(V)\n}\n\n# Starting membrane potentials\ndf <- lapply(c(-50,-60,-65,-68,-72,-75,-80,-90), function(x) {\n           data.table(v = membrane_potential(time, V0 = x, g_L = 0.1, E_L = -70),\n                      start_v = x,\n                      time = time)\n         }) |> \n  rbindlist()\n\n# Create the plot using ggplot2\nggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = v, color = ordered(start_v))) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -70, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) + # Add E_L line\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time (Arbitrary Units)\",\n    y = \"Membrane Potential (mV)\",\n    title = \"Membrane Potential Decay Due to Leak Current\",\n    color = \"Starting Voltage (mV)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Membrane Potential and Leak Current**. Here we can see that the membrane tends to return to its resting potential. This behavior is accomplished by the tweaks we made earlier to our exponential function.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if we inject a small current that briefly changes the membrane potential to -60 mV, the membrane potential will decay back to -70 mV, following the equation.\n\n#### Too Simple?\n\nThis simple model is important because it shows us how the membrane potential would behave *passively*, **in the absence of any active processes**. It explains how the resting membrane potential is maintained. However, **it <u>doesn't</u> explain the rapid, dramatic changes we see during an action potential**. Our sleepy neuron is still just leaking and slowly returning to its resting state. It's like watching paint dry (not exactly thrilling). We need something more to explain the neuron's \"shouting\" behavior. **That \"something more\" is the introduction of <u>voltage-gated ion channels</u>**, which we'll explore in the next section.\n\nOkay, let's add some simplified equations to represent the voltage-gated channels and incorporate them into our membrane potential equation.\n\n# Adding Voltage-Gated Channels: The Key to Excitation\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n![](recording-animation.gif){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Photo from [Human Bio Media](https://www.humanbiomedia.org/action-potential-media/)]{.aside}\n:::\n\nOkay, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. **How does this whole \"voltage\" thing actually work?** Well, picture this: the change in voltage over time (basically how fast the voltage is shifting), **is all about the flow of ions**. You've got ions lazily leaking through the membrane (let's call that the \"lazy ion flow\"), and then you've got the more exciting players: sodium, potassium, and even some other ions that like to join the party. \n\nSo, if we want to get fancy, we could say that **the change in voltage over time**, which we can write as $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ for all you math whizzes out there, **is basically a sum of all these ion flows**. We've got the lazy ion flow ($I_L$), the sodium party crashers ($I_{Na}$), the potassium crew ($I_K$), and any other surprise guests ($I_{\\text{other ions}}$). \n\nAnd if we want to put it all together in a fancy equation, we could say that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = I_L + I_{Na} + I_K + \\dots + I_{\\text{other ions}}\n$$\n\nSo, now we've got this \"leaky current\" ($I_L$), which we can basically describe using that fancy equation $-g_L \\cdot (V_0 - E_L)$. **But what about those exciting voltage-gated channels?** How do we explain their contribution to the party? To figure that out, we need to dive deeper into the wild world of channel dynamics.\n\n**Remember our boring old passive membrane?** It just kind of slumped back to its resting potential, like a deflated balloon. Well, **our active neurons** are a whole different story. They've **got these amazing channels that open and close depending on the voltage**, making the whole system much more exciting. \n\n**These channels**, especially the sodium ($Na^+$) and potassium ($K^+$) channels, **are the real stars of the show**. They're the ones that cause those dramatic swings in voltage during an action potential.\n\n**<u>Sodium channels</u>** are like little gates. They have an *\"activation gate\"* (let's call it gate $m$) that swings **open around -55 mV**. This is like the starting pistol for the race! **Sodium ions flood into the cell, and the voltage skyrockets**. But here's the catch: these channels also have an *\"inactivation gate\"* (let's call it gate $h$) that slams **shut around +30 mV**. It's like the emergency brakes! This **prevents the cell from exploding with too much sodium**. And don't worry, **the inactivation gate eventually reopens** when the cell calms down and returns to its resting potential (around -70 mV). \n\n![](sodium-channel-open-state.png){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Sodium channel in an open state, illustrating its activation and inactivation gates. Photo from [Human Bio Media](https://www.humanbiomedia.org/action-potential-media/)]{.aside}\n\nSo, if we want to express the sodium current ($I_{Na}$) in all its glory, we could say that:\n\n$$\nI_{Na} = -g_{Na} \\cdot m \\cdot h \\cdot (V_0 - E_{Na})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $g_{Na}$: **Sodium conductance** (how easily sodium ions flow when channels are open).\n- $m$: Sodium **activation gate** (1 = open, 0 = closed).\n- $h$: Sodium **inactivation gate** (1 = open, 0 = closed). This gate introduces a delay and helps terminate the sodium current.\n- $E_{Na}$: Sodium **reversal potential**.\n\nIn contrast, **potassium channels are a bit simpler**. They only have one gate (let's call it gate $n$), which **acts like a slow-opening door**. This gate starts to swing **open around +30mV**, allowing potassium ions to flood out of the cell. This outflow of positive charge **helps bring the voltage back down to resting potential** (a phase we call \"repolarization\"). But here's the twist: this gate is a bit slow to close. **It doesn't fully shut until the voltage dips below -80 mV**, which is even more negative than the resting potential. This creates a slight undershoot before the cell finally settles back down. \n\n![](potassium-channel-open-state.png){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Potassium channel in an open state, with its only voltage-dependent gate.

We'll assume these gates simply snap open and shut based on the voltage.

These parameters represent the **properties of our neuron**, such as how *\"leaky\"* the membrane is and the properties of the sodium and potassium channels. We also need to define **the time step** (`dt`), which determines how often we *\"take a picture\"* of the membrane potential during our simulation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Parameters\nparams <- list(\n  g_L = 1, E_L = -70,   ## Leak Channels\n  g_Na = 20, E_Na = 30, ## Sodium Channels\n  g_K = 2, E_K = -90,   ## Potassium Channels\n  dt = 0.001\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere:\n\n- `g_L`: Leak conductance.\n- `E_L`: Leak reversal potential (resting potential).\n- `g_Na`: Sodium conductance.\n- `E_Na`: Sodium reversal potential.\n- `g_K`: Potassium conductance.\n- `E_K`: Potassium reversal potential.\n- `dt`: Time step (0.001 ms).\n\n#### The Sodium Activation Gate: The On/Off Switch\n\nThe **sodium activation** gate (`m`) is like the *\"on\"* switch for sodium channels. When the membrane potential (`V_prev`) reaches a critical point, around -55 mV, **this gate swings open instantly**, allowing sodium ions to flood in. It's like someone yelling *\"Go!\"* at a starting line. \n\nIn our simplified model, **we're making a big assumption**: this gate is an *all-or-nothing* switch. Either it's completely open (`m` becomes 1) or completely closed (`m` is 0). **This is a simplification**, but it helps us capture the essence of the rapid rise of the action potential. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nupdate_m <- function(V_prev) {\n  ifelse(V_prev > -55, 1, 0)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function takes the previous membrane potential (`V_prev`) as input **and tells us whether the sodium activation gate is open or closed**. \n\n#### The Sodium Inactivation Gate: The Emergency Brake\n\nThe **sodium inactivation gate** (`h`) is like the emergency brake for the sodium channels. It starts open (`h` = 1) at rest, but when the membrane depolarizes and sodium channels open wide (`m` = 1), this gate slowly starts to close (`h` transitions towards 0). This **is crucial to prevent a runaway influx of sodium**. \n\nHowever, the **inactivation gate only starts to close when the membrane potential is sufficiently positive** (around +20 mV). It's like the brake only engages when the car is going fast enough. \n\nConversely, when the membrane repolarizes and **the sodium channels close** (`m` = 0), the inactivation gate slowly reopens (`h` transitions towards 1). But **this recovery only happens when the membrane potential is sufficiently negative** (around -70 mV). It's like the brake only releases when the car has slowed down significantly. \n\nThis conditional behavior is implemented in the following function: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nupdate_h <- function(m_current, V_prev, h_prev) {\n  ifelse(\n    test = m_current == 1 & V_prev >= 20, \n    yes = 0, \n    no = ifelse(\n      test = m_current == 0 & V_prev <= -70, \n      yes = 1, \n      no = h_prev\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function takes the current value of `m` (`m_current`), the previous membrane potential (`V_prev`), and the previous value of `h` (`h_prev`) as inputs and **returns the updated value of `h`**.\n\n#### The Potassium Activation Gate: The Slow and Steady Door\n\nThe **potassium activation gate** (`n`) is like a slow-opening door. It **starts to open when the membrane potential reaches a sufficiently positive value** (around +20 mV). But unlike the sodium gate, it's a bit sluggish. \n\nThere's also a bit of *\"hysteresis\"* here. This means that the potassium gate **only closes when the membrane potential becomes extremely negative** (around -80 mV) and it was already open in the previous time step. **It's like the door is reluctant to close once it's been opened**. This hysteresis ensures that the membrane repolarizes completely before the potassium channels fully close. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nupdate_n <- function(V_prev, n_prev) {\n  ifelse(\n    test = V_prev >= 20, \n    yes = 1, \n    no = ifelse(\n      test = V_prev <= -80 & n_prev == 1, \n      yes = 0, \n      no = n_prev\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function takes the previous membrane potential (`V_prev`) and the previous value of `n` (`n_prev`) as input and **returns the updated value of `n`**.\n\n#### Calculating the Ion Flows: The Grand Finale\n\nThis function calculates the flow of ions across the membrane. We have three main players: \n\n- **The Leaky Current:** This is the *\"background\"* current, where ions slowly leak through the membrane. \n- **The Sodium Current:** This is where the action happens! It's influenced by the sodium activation gate (`m`) and the inactivation gate (`h`). \n- **The Potassium Current:** This current is controlled by the potassium activation gate (`n`).\n\nTo calculate each current, we use a simple formula: $I = g \\cdot (V - E)$. **It's like calculating the flow of water through a pipe**, where $g$ represents the size of the pipe, $V$ is the pressure difference, and $E$ is a kind of \"equilibrium point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate_currents <- \n  function(V_prev, m, h, n, params) {\n    \n  l_current <- -params$g_L * (V_prev - params$E_L)\n  na_current <- -params$g_Na * m * h * (V_prev - params$E_Na)\n  k_current <- -params$g_K * n * (V_prev - params$E_K)\n  \n  output <- list(l_current = l_current, \n                 na_current = na_current, \n                 k_current = k_current)\n  \n  return(output)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function takes the previous membrane potential (`V_prev`), the gating variables (`m`, `h`, `n`), and the parameters (`params`) as input and **returns a list containing the calculated currents**.\n\n#### Simulating Neurons in Action: Bringing it All Together!\n\nThis is the grand finale! **This function brings all the pieces together** to simulate how our neuron actually behaves. It takes the <u>model parameters</u>, a <u>time vector</u> (which tells us how long to run the simulation), and a <u>stimulus current</u> (like an external input to the neuron) as input. \n\nThen, **it iterates through each time step**, updating the gating variables (those pesky \"m,\" \"h,\" and \"n\" gates) and **calculating how the membrane potential changes** using the Euler method. It's like watching a movie frame-by-frame, seeing how the neuron responds to the different inputs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimulate_ap <- function(params, time, stimulus_current) {\n  n <- length(time)\n  V <- rep(params$E_L, n) # Initialize Membrane potential\n  m <- numeric(n) # Initialize Sodium Activation\n  h <- rep(1, n) # Initialize Sodium Inactivation\n  n_inf <- numeric(n) # Initialize Potassium Activation\n  l_current <- numeric(n) # Initialize Leak Current\n  na_current <- numeric(n) # Initialize Sodium Current\n  k_current <- numeric(n) # Initialize Potassium Current\n  \n  for (i in 2:n) {\n    ## Updates the state of each channel's gates\n    m[i] <- update_m(V[i - 1])\n    h[i] <- update_h(m[i], V[i - 1], h[i - 1])\n    n_inf[i] <- update_n(V[i - 1], n_inf[i - 1])\n    \n    ## Compute the current \n    currents <- calculate_currents(\n      V_prev = V[i - 1], \n      m = m[i], \n      h = h[i], \n      n = n_inf[i], \n      params = params\n    )\n    \n    l_current[i] <- currents$l_current\n    na_current[i] <- currents$na_current\n    k_current[i] <- currents$k_current\n    \n    ## Sum each current contribution to the overall voltage change\n    dVdt <- \n      l_current[i] + \n      na_current[i] + \n      k_current[i] + \n      stimulus_current[i]\n    \n    ## Update the Voltage based on current net flow\n    V[i] <- \n      V[i - 1] + dVdt * params$dt\n  }\n  \n  output <- data.table(Time = time, Voltage = V)\n  return(output)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function gets the party started! **It initializes the membrane potential and all those gating variables** (\"m,\" \"h,\" and \"n\") to their starting values. Then, it enters a loop, **stepping through time** and updating these variables at each step. It's like watching a movie play out *frame-by-frame*, observing how the membrane potential changes in response to the shifting currents.\n\nNow, **let's run this simulation and see what happens!** We'll visualize the results to get a better understanding of how the neuron behaves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Simulation time\ntime <- seq(0, 8, by = params$dt)\n\n# Stimulus\nstimulus_current <- numeric(length(time))\nstimulus_current[time > 2 & time < 2.5] <- 50\n\n# Run the simulation\ndf <- simulate_ap(params, time, stimulus_current)\n\n# Plotting\nggplot(df, aes(Time, Voltage)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -70, linewidth = 1/2, linetype = 2, col = \"gray50\") +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = \"orange\") +\n  labs(x = \"Time (ms)\", y = \"Membrane Potential (mV)\", title = \"Simplified Action Potential Model\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Simplified Action Potential Model**. Here we can see that after taking into account each contribution to the overall voltage dynamics over time (based on net current flow), we can see something more alike to a real action potential curve.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Systematically vary key parameters, such as: -->\n# Tweaking the Knobs: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nNow that we have our neuron simulation up and running, let's see what happens when we start tinkering with the settings. This is called *sensitivity analysis*. **We'll systematically change one parameter at a time and see how it affects the neuron's behavior**. It's like tweaking the knobs on a radio to see how it changes the sound. \n\nThis analysis is **crucial for understanding how our model works** and figuring out which parameters have the biggest impact on the action potential. It's like trying to figure out **which ingredients are most important** for baking the perfect cake.\n\nTo make this process easier, we'll create a special function called `sensitivity_analysis`. This function takes the model parameters, the time vector, the stimulus current, the name of the parameter we want to change (`param_name`), and a list of values we want to test for that parameter (`values`) as input. It then **runs the simulation for each value in the list**, stores the results, and combines them all into a single, organized data frame. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsensitivity_analysis <- \n  function(params, time, stimulus_current, param_name, values) {\n  \n    results <- vector(mode = \"list\")\n    \n    for (value in values) {\n      # Modify the parameter value\n      modified_params <- params\n      modified_params[[param_name]] <- value \n      \n      # Run the simulation\n      df <- simulate_ap(modified_params, time, stimulus_current) \n      \n      # Add a column to track the parameter value\n      df$ParameterValue <- value\n      \n      # Store the results\n      results[[as.character(value)]] <- df\n    }\n    \n    output <- rbindlist(results)\n    return(output) # Combine all data.tables into one\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the function, we do the following:\n\n1. **Create an empty list:** We create an empty list called `results` to store the output of each simulation. Think of it as an empty box to store all our simulation results.\n2. **Loop through the values:** We loop through each value in the list of values we want to test. It's like trying different settings on a machine one by one.\n3. **Make a copy:** We create a copy of our original parameters called `modified_params`. This is crucial to avoid messing up the original settings.\n4. **Tweak the parameter:** We modify the specific parameter (`param_name`) in our `modified_params` copy to the current value from our list.\n5. **Run the simulation:** We run our `simulate_ap` function with these modified parameters to see how the neuron behaves.\n6. **Add a label:** We add a new column called `ParameterValue` to the results to keep track of which parameter value we used for that simulation. It's like labeling each experiment.\n7. **Store the results:** We store the results of this simulation in our `results` list, using the parameter value as a label for easy reference.\n8. **Combine the results:** Finally, we use a special function called `rbindlist` to neatly combine all the individual data frames in our `results` list into one big data frame. This gives us a complete overview of how the neuron behaves with different parameter settings.\n\n#### The Plotting Function: Seeing the Results\n\nNow, let's visualize our results! We'll create a special function called `plot_sensitivity` to do this. This function takes the combined results data frame and the name of the parameter we were analyzing as input. It then generates a plot that shows how the membrane potential changes over time **for each of the parameter values we tested**. It's like creating a visual story of how the neuron behaves under different conditions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_sensitivity <- function(results, param_name) {\n  ggplot(results, aes(Time, Voltage, color = factor(ParameterValue))) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = -70, linewidth = 1/2, linetype = 2, col = \"gray50\") +\n    geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n    labs(x = \"Time (ms)\", y = \"Membrane Potential (mV)\", \n         title = scales::label_parse()(paste(\"Sensitivity~Analysis~of~\", param_name))) +\n    scale_color_ordinal(name = scales::label_parse()(param_name))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function creates a line plot using `ggplot2`, where the x-axis represents time, the y-axis represents the membrane potential, and **different colors represent different values of the varied parameter**. The `factor()` function is used to treat the `ParameterValue` as a categorical variable, ensuring that each value gets a distinct color in the plot.\n\n![](math-confused-girl.jpeg){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Your face after I told you that we're going to see the basics and it turned out not so basic after all.

We'll run the simulation from 0 to 8 milliseconds (ms).\n- **Time Step:** We need to decide how often we \"take a picture\" of the membrane potential. This is determined by the `dt` parameter in our `params` list.\n- **Stimulus:** We'll create a brief stimulus current, like a little jolt of electricity, that's applied between 0.5 and 1.0 milliseconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulation time and stimulus\ntime <- seq(0, 6, by = params$dt)\nstimulus_current <- numeric(length = length(time))\nstimulus_current[time > 0.5 & time < 1.0] <- 50\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Assessing the Effect of Sodium Conductance ($g_{Na}$): Turning Up the Heat\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we tweak the sodium conductance ($g_{Na}$). This is like adjusting the heat on a stove. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Run sensitivity analysis for g_Na\ngna_values <- c(9.5, 10, 12, 15, 20)\n\ngna_results <- sensitivity_analysis(params, time, stimulus_current, \"g_Na\", gna_values)\n\nplot_sensitivity(gna_results, \"g[Na]\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Effect of Sodium Conductance in Potential Dynamics**. Here we can see the overall effect of changing the sodium conductance on membrane potential dynamics.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy running our `sensitivity_analysis` function and then plotting the results, we can clearly see how **changing $g_{Na}$ affects the action potential**. It's like watching how turning up the heat affects how quickly water boils. As expected, increasing $g_{Na}$ makes the depolarization much faster and more dramatic. \n\n#### Assessing the Effect of Potassium Conductance ($g_{K}$): Controlling the Cool-Down\n\nNext, let's see how changing the potassium conductance ($g_{K}$) affects things. This is like adjusting the thermostat, **it controls the cool-down period**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Run sensitivity analysis for g_K\ngk_values <- c(1, 2, 5, 10)\n\ngk_results <- sensitivity_analysis(params, time, stimulus_current, \"g_K\", gk_values)\n\nplot_sensitivity(gk_results, \"g[K]\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Effect of Potassium Conductance in Potential Dynamics**. Here we can see the overall effect of changing the potassium conductance on membrane potential dynamics.](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, using our handy functions, we can easily see how $g_{K}$ impacts the action potential. Increasing $g_{K}$ **makes the repolarization phase much faster and more pronounced**. It's like adding more ice to a hot drink, it cools down much quicker. This structured approach allows us to efficiently explore how **different parameters affect our model** and gain a deeper understanding of its dynamics.\n\n# So, You Think You Know How a Neuron Fires? Think Again!\n\nOkay, let's be honest, this *\"action potential\"* business is a bit overhyped. It's basically just a fancy term for a **sudden influx of sodium ions followed by a swift efflux of potassium**. Really, who needs all those fancy textbooks and intimidating equations? (Kidding! We need them).\n\nOur little model here? Yeah, it's basically a *\"neuron for beginners\"*. **We stripped it down to the essentials**, ignoring the nitty-gritty details like how ion channels actually open and close and the subtle ways different potassium channels interact. **Who needs that level of detail, right?**.\n[In fact we do! But that's much level of detail is reserved for another blog post]{.aside}\n\nNow, let's get real for a second. Real neurons? They're not this simple. Oh no. **They have a whole zoo of ion channels**, each with its own quirks and preferences for voltage. Sodium channels? Potassium channels? Please, **it's more like a neurochemical orchestra!** And don't even get me started on the calcium-dependent potassium channels... \n\nBut hey, our little *\"dumbed-down\"* neuron serves a purpose. It's like, the *\"Cliff's Notes\"* of neurophysiology. You get the main idea, **you understand the basic principles of membrane excitability**. And that, my friends, is enough to impress at your next cocktail party. \n\nNow, **let's talk about drugs**. Oh boy, drugs. You know, those pesky little molecules that interfere with neuronal signaling? Well, guess what? **They love to target these ion channels**. Lidocaine? Blocks sodium channels, basically shutting down the neuron. Potassium channel blockers? Well, let's just say they can make neurons go wild. **Our model? It can predict these effects**, to a certain extent. Of course, it's not exactly a perfect predictor of pharmacological outcomes. But hey, it's a start.\n\nAnd finally, **let's talk about the big picture**. Communication. You know, how your brain actually *does* stuff? Well, **it all starts with these action potentials**. They're like, the brain's version of Morse code. But instead of dots and dashes, it's a symphony of electrical impulses, traveling along axons and **triggering the release of neurotransmitters**. And our little model? It gives us a glimpse into this mysterious world of neuronal chatter. \n\n![](multipolar-neurons.jpg){.img-fluid width=\"100%\"}\n[Motor Neurons (Multipolar) with many Processes (mostly Dendrites).

Our *\"simplified\"* action potential model. Not exactly a perfect mirror of reality, but hey, it's a good start.

But hey, at least **now you have a basic understanding of how these amazing cells work**.\n[**Disclaimer**: This model is for entertainment purposes only.
